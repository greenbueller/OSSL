 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Legacy of 10/10/10"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 SSB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the chaos of the collapse of St. Martin, a young socialist woman rallied the people of Simpson Bay and the area around the airport in order to bring about peace to the area once the chaos of panicked flights leaving settled."
 NCT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Snoopy Island was previously an island of the rich, not permanently inhabited by anyone and served as only a stepping stone for the rest of the island as a place for rich folk to dock their expensive mega yachts. While visiting the island, Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich found himself embroiled in the collapse, and has declared himself ruler of Snoopy Island, renaming it to new Chukotka."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new Germany has risen. Three years have passed since the Weimar Republic was dismantled and replaced by Hitler's Third Reich. Economic stability has returned after the trying years of the Great Depression, and mass unemployment has been dealt with.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty are long forgotten, and the Wehrmacht grows stronger by the day. Another Weltkrieg is on the horizon."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Italian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Soviet Union is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Why not explore another nation's story in this tropical chaos?"
